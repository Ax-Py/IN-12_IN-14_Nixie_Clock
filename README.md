# IN-12_IN-14_Nixie_Clock

Nixie tube clock that can accept either the horizontal IN-12(B) or the vertical IN-14 tubes. Utilizes a 2x6 NPN BJT matrix to convert 8 I/O to 12. Diodes are used to prevent an overvoltage event from floating outputs. Current is steered by changing the potential of the rows/columns. Goal was to allow the clock to run from a USB2.0 port on a PC (max of 500mA/2.5W).
